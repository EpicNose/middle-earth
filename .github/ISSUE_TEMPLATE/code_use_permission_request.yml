        ## Why are we requesting permission to use our code?
        Fundamentally, we wish others to learn from our project but we still want to keep some of our content under our control.
        By having the requests via github, we have all the permissions archived, protecting the user and us at the same time.
        We are keeping the code open source, letting other developers to learn from us and see if they need to make a request beforehand.
        We are going by trust, if we see that code have been stolen without our consent then we may take action against it with Modrinth/Curseforge.
